   <h4> To discovering new worlds, and leaving our “mark” along the way. </h4>
   <h3>We are a company that specializes in making ecofriendly customizable malleable aluminum metal bookmarks that can fold in any place to simultaneously mark the page and bend to mark the sentence or line of the selected page. </h3>

   <p>We got our inspiration for our name from a flower named zinnia because they are colorful and last through the season. Just like our product!  </p> <!-- How to comment-->
